 1Cg in Two Pages

1. Cg by Example 
Cg is a language for programming GPUs. Cg programs look a lot 
like C programs. Here is a Cg vertex program: 
void simpleTransform( float4 objectPosition : POSITION, 
                     float4 color          : COLOR, 
                     float4 decalCoord     : TEXCOORD0, 
                     float4 lightMapCoord  : TEXCOORD1, 
                 out float4  clipPosition   : POSITION, 
                 out float4  oColor         : COLOR, 
                 out float4  oDecalCoord    : TEXCOORD0, 
                 out float4  oLightMapCoord : TEXCOORD1, 
             uniform float  brightness, 
             uniform float4x4  modelViewProjection) 
{ 
  clipPosition = mul(modelViewProjection, objectPosition); 
  oColor = brightness * color; 
  oDecalCoord = decalCoord;   oLightMapCoord = lightMapCoord; } 
1.1 Vertex Program Explanation 
The program transforms an object-space position for a vertex by a 
4x4 matrix containing the concatenation of the modeling, viewing, and projection transforms. The resulting vector is output as the clip-space position of the vertex. The per-vertex color is scaled by a floating-point parameter prior to output. Also, two texture coordinate sets are passed through unperturbed. 
Cg supports scalar data types such as float  but also has first-class 
support for vector data types. float4  represents a vector of four 
floats. float4x4  represents a matrix. mul is a standard library 
routine that performs matrix by vector multiplication. Cg provides 
function overloading like C++; mul is an overloaded function so it 
can be used to multiply all combinations of vectors and matrices. 
Cg provides the same operators as C. Unlike C however, Cg 
operators accept and return vectors as well as scalars. For example, the scalar, brightness , scales the vector, color , as you would 
expect. 
In Cg, declaring a parameter with the uniform  modifier indicates 
that its value is initialized by an external source that will not vary 
over a given batch of vertices. In this respect, the uniform  modifier 
in Cg is different from the uniform modifier in RenderMan but 
used in similar contexts. In practice, the external source is some 
OpenGL or Direct3D state that your application takes care to load appropriately. For example, your application must supply the modelViewProjection  matrix and the brightness  scalar. The Cg 
runtime library provides an API for loading your application state 
into the appropriate API state required by the compiled program. 
The POSITION , COLOR , TEXCOORD0 , and TEXCOORD1  identifiers 
following the objectPosition , color , decalCoord , and 
lightMapCoord  parameters are input semantics. They indicate how 
their parameters are initialized by per-vertex varying data. In 
OpenGL, glVertex  commands feed the POSITION  input semantic; 
glColor  commands feed the COLOR  semantic; glMultiTexCoord commands feed the TEXCOORDn semantics. 
The out modifier indicates that clipPosition,  oColor , 
oDecalCoord, and oLightMapCoord  parameters are output by the 
program. The semantics that follow these parameters are therefore 
output semantics. The respective semantics indicate the program outputs a transformed clip-space position and a scaled color. Also, two sets of texture coordinates are passed through. The resulting vertex is feed to primitive assembly to eventually generate a primitive for rasterization.  
Compiling the program requires the program source code, the 
name of the entry function to compile ( simpleTransform ), and a 
profile name ( vs_1_1 ). 
The Cg compiler can then compile the above Cg program into the 
following DirectX 8 vertex shader: 
  vs.1.1 
  mov oT0, v7 
  mov oT1, v8 
  dp4 oPos.x, c1, v0 
  dp4 oPos.y, c2, v0 
  dp4 oPos.z, c3, v0 
  dp4 oPos.w, c4, v0 
  mul oD0, c0.x, v5 
The profile indicates for what API execution environment the 
program should be compiled. This same program can be compiled for the DirectX 9 vertex shader profile ( vs_2_0 ), the multi-vendor 
OpenGL vertex program extension ( arbvp1 ), or NVIDIA-
proprietary OpenGL extensions ( vp20  & vp30 ). 
The process of compiling Cg programs can take place during the 
initialization of your application using Cg. The Cg runtime contains the Cg compiler as well as API-dependent routines that greatly simplify the process of configuring your compiled program for use with either OpenGL or Direct3D. 
1.2 Fragment Program Explanation 
In addition to writing programs to process vertices, you can write 
programs to process fragments. Here is a Cg fragment program: 
float4 brightLightMapDecal( float4 color         : COLOR, 
                           float4 decalCoord    : TEXCOORD0, 
                           float4 lightMapCoord : TEXCOORD1, 
                   uniform sampler2D  decal, 
                   uniform sampler2D  lightMap) : COLOR 
{ 
  float4 d = tex2Dproj(decal, decalCoord); 
  float4 lm = tex2Dproj(lightMap, lightMapCoord); 
  return 2.0 * color * d * lm; 
} 
The input parameters correspond to the interpolated color and two 
texture coordinate sets as designated by their input semantics. 
The sampler2D  type corresponds to a 2D texture unit. The Cg 
standard library routine tex2Dproj  performs a projective 2D 
texture lookup. The two tex2Dproj  calls sample a decal and light 
map texture and assign the result to the local variables, d and lm, 
respectively.   
 2The program multiplies the two textures results, the interpolated 
color, and the constant 2.0 together and returns this RGBA color. The program returns a float4  and the semantic for the return value 
is COLOR , the final color of the fragment. 
The Cg compiler generates the following code for 
brightLightMapDecal when compiled with the arbfp1  multi-
vendor OpenGL fragment profile: 
  !!ARBfp1.0 
  PARAM c0 = {2, 2, 2, 2}; TEMP R0; TEMP R1; TEMP R2; 
  TXP R0, fragment.texcoord[0], texture[0], 2D; 
  TXP R1, fragment.texcoord[1], texture[1], 2D; 
  MUL R2, c0.x, fragment.color.primary; 
  MUL R0, R2, R0; 
  MUL result.color, R0, R1; 
  END 
This same program also compiles for the DirectX 8 and 9 profiles 
(ps_1_3  & ps_2_x ) and NVIDIA-proprietary OpenGL extensions 
(fp20  & fp30 ). 
2. Other Cg Functionality 
2.1 Features from C 
Cg provides structures and arrays, including multi-dimensional 
arrays. Cg provides all of C’s arithmetic operators ( +, *, /, etc.). Cg 
provides a boolean  type and boolean and relational operators (||, 
&&, !, etc.). Cg provides increment/decrement ( ++/--) operators, 
the conditional expression operator ( ?:), assignment expressions 
(+=, etc.), and even the C comma operator. 
Cg provides user-defined functions (in addition to pre-defined 
standard library functions), but recursive functions are not allowed. Cg provides a subset of C’s control flow constructs ( do, while , 
for, if, break , continue ); other constructs such as goto  and 
switch  are not supported in current the current Cg implementation 
but the necessary keywords are reserved. 
Like C, Cg does not mandate the precision and range of its data 
types. In practice, the profile chosen for compilation determines the concrete representation for each data type. float , half , and 
double  are meant to represent continuous values, ideally in 
floating-point, but this can depend on the profile. half  is intended 
for a 16-bit half-precision floating-point data type. (NVIDIA’s 
CineFX architecture provides such a data type.) int is an integer 
data type, usually used for looping and indexing. fixed  is an 
additional data type intended to represent a fixed-point continuous 
data type that may not be floating-point. 
Cg provides #include , #define , #ifdef , etc. matching the C 
preprocessor. Cg supports C and C++ comments. 
2.2 Additional Features Not in C 
Cg provides built-in constructors (similar to C++ but not user-
defined) for vector data types: 
  float4 vec1 = float4(4.0, -2.0, 5.0, 3.0); 
Swizzling is a way of rearranging components of vector values and constructing shorter or longer vectors. Example: 
  float2 vec2 = vec1.yx;        // vec2 = (-2.0, 4.0) 
  float scalar = vec1.w;        // scalar = 3.0   float3 vec3 = scalar.xxx;     // vec3 = (3.0, 3.0, 3.0) 
More complicated swizzling syntax is available for matrices. 
Vector and matrix elements can also be accessed with standard array indexing syntax as well. 
Write masking restricts vector assignments to indicated 
components. Example:   vec1.xw = vec3;  // vec1 = (3.0, -2.0, 5.0, 3.0) 
Use either .xyzw or .rgba suffixes swizzling and write masking. 
The Cg standard library includes a large set of built-in functions 
for mathematics ( abs, dot, log2 , reflect , rsqrt , etc.) and texture 
access (texCUBE , tex3Dproj , etc.). The standard library makes 
extensive use of function overloading (similar to C++) to support 
different vector lengths and data types. There is no need to use #include  to obtain prototypes for standard library routines as in C; 
Cg standard library routines are automatically prototyped. 
In addition to the out modifier for call-by-result  parameter 
passing, the inout  modifier treats a parameter as both a call-by-
value  input parameter and a call-by-result  output parameter.  
The discard  keyword is similar to return  but aborts the 
processing without returning a transformed fragment. 
2.3 Features Not Supported 
Cg has no support currently for pointers or bitwise operations 
(however, the necessary C operators and keywords are reserved for this purpose). Cg does not (currently) support unions and function variables. 
Cg lacks C++ features for “programming in the large” such as 
classes, templates, operator overloading, exception handling, and namespaces. 
The Cg standard library lacks routines for functionality such as 
string processing, file input/output, and memory allocation, which is beyond the specialized scope of Cg. 
However, Cg reserves all C and C++ keywords so that features 
from these languages could be incorporated into future implementations of Cg as warranted.  
3. Profile Dependencies 
When you compile a C or C++ program, you expect it to compile 
without regard to how big (within reason) the program is or what the program does. With Cg, a syntactically and semantically correct program may still not compile due to limitations of the profile for which you are compiling the program. 
For example, it is currently an error to access a texture when 
compiling with a vertex profile. Future vertex profiles may well allow texture accesses, but existing vertex profiles do not. Other errors are more inherent. For example, a fragment profile should not output a parameter with a TEXCOORD0  semantic. Other errors 
may be due to exceeding a capacity limit of current GPUs such as 
the maximum number of instructions or the number of texture units available. 
Understand that these profile dependent errors do not reflect 
limitations of the Cg language, but rather limitations of the current implementation of Cg or the underlying hardware limitations of your target GPU. 
4. Compatibility and Portability 
NVIDIA’s Cg implementation and Microsoft’s High Level 
Shading Language (HLSL) both implement the same language. While HLSL is tightly integrated to DirectX 9 and the Windows operating systems, Cg provides support for multiple APIs (OpenGL, DirectX 8, and DirectX 9) and multiple operating systems (Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X). Because Cg interfaces to multi-vendor APIs, Cg runs on GPUs from multiple vendors.
